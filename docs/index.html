                    <p>
                        CISA's Logging Made Easy (LME) is a no cost, open source platform that centralizes log collection, enhances threat detection, and enables real-time alerting, helping small to medium-sized organizations secure their infrastructure. Whether you're upgrading from a previous version or deploying for the first time, LME offers a scalable, efficient solution for logging and endpoint security.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Who is LME for?</h1>
                    <p>
                        From single IT administrators with a handful of devices in their network to small and medium-sized agencies. Really, for anyone! LME is intended for organizations that:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Need a log management and threat detection system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not have an existing Security Operations Center (SOC), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution or log management and monitoring capabilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Work within limited budgets, time or expertise to set up and manage a logging and threat detection system.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
