                        <p>
                            CISA's Logging Made Easy (LME) is a no cost, open source platform that centralizes log collection, enhances threat detection, and enables real-time alerting, helping small to medium-sized organizations secure their infrastructure. Whether you're upgrading from a previous version or deploying for the first time, LME offers a scalable, efficient solution for logging and endpoint security.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Who is LME for?</h1>

                            From single IT administrators with a handful of devices in their network to small and medium-sized agencies. Really, for anyone! LME is intended for organizations that:
