                    <h1>FAQ</h1>
                    <h2>1. What Is CISA’s Logging Made Easy (LME)?</h2>
                    <p>LME is a no-cost log management solution for small- to medium-sized organizations with limited
                        resources that would otherwise have little to no functionality to detect attacks. LME offers
                        centralized logging for Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems, enabling proactive threat
                        detection and enhanced security by allowing organizations to monitor their networks, identify
                        users, and actively analyze Sysmon data to quickly detect potential malicious activity.</p>

                    <h2>2. What makes LME unique?</h2>
                    <p>LME stands out as an accessible, open source log management and threat detection solution
                        developed by CISA to support organizations with limited resources. By integrating Elastic and
                        Wazuh in a secure, containerized stack, it provides endpoint security and real-time alerting
                        without the complexity or cost of traditional SIEMs. Designed with customizable dashboards and
                        Secure by Design principles, LME offers a user-friendly, effective solution to enhance
                        visibility and strengthen threat detection.</p>

                    <h2>3. What software drives LME?</h2>
                    <p>LME is powered by Elastic Stack (for log management, search, and visualization), Wazuh (for
                        endpoint detection and response), and Podman (for containerization). This open source stack
                        ensures transparency, flexibility and scalability while providing enhanced threat detection and
                        customizable dashboards.</p>

                    <h2>4. Which operating systems can use LME?</h2>
                    <p>LME 2.0 supports Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. Elastic and Wazuh agents enable
                        compatibility across these platforms, ensuring broad coverage for monitoring and logging. While
                        Wazuh agents also support Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX operating systems, CISA has not tested LME on
                        endpoints running these operating systems.</p>

                    <h2>5. Who can use LME?</h2>
                    <p>While intended for small to medium-sized organizations with limited resources, anyone can
                        download and use LME. Reference <a href="installation-prereqs.html">LME 2.0 Prerequisite
                            documentation</a> for more details on required infrastructure and hardware including CPU,
                        memory, and storage requirements.</p>

                    <h2>6. Can LME run in the cloud?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. LME supports both on-premises and cloud deployments, allowing organizations to host LME on local
                        or cloud service provider (CSP) infrastructure. See our documentation about LME in the cloud <a href="cloud.html">here.</a></p>

                    <h2>7. Does LME 2.0
                        require a new install or an update to existing installs?</h2>
                    <p>Both new and existing users must complete a full install of LME 2.0.</p>
                    <p>LME has an upgrade process from v1.4 -&gt; 2.0. The upgrade uninstalls 1.4 and installs 2.0, and
                        will reintegrate old dashboards and data into the new 2.0 deployment. Checkout our <a
                            href="upgrading.html">upgrading documentation</a> for more information on upgrading from
                        an older version of LME to LME 2.0.</p>

                    <h2>8. How do I download LME?</h2>
                    <p>Detailed installation and download steps can be found <a
                            href="installation-overview.html">here.</a></p>

                    <h2>9. In light of LME 2.0, will
                        older versions of LME stop working?</h2>
                    <p>While CISA recommends upgrading to LME 2.0, users can continue using older versions of LME,
                        however, CISA will not support older versions. </p>

                    <h2>
                        10. How do I transition/migrate from older versions to LME 2.0 while retaining my log history?
                    </h2>
                    <p style="color: red">For existing LME users, <a href="/scripts/upgrade">click here</a> for easy instructions on
                        transferring log history from previous versions. LME will automatically reintegrate your log
                        history and data.</p>

                    <h2>11. Can I transfer my customized
                        dashboards? If so, how?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, you can import your dashboards on Elastic from Stack Management &gt; Kibana &gt; Saved
                        Objects and click import and select the custom dashboard ndjson file to import it into your
                        Elastic instance. You&#39;ll need to export your old dashboards first. </p>

                    <h2>12. Are there new system requirements for
                        LME 2.0?</h2>
                    <p>Although system requirements are mostly the same for LME 2.0, we do have hardware and
                        infrastructure recommendations in our <a href="installation-prereqs.html">LME 2.0
                            Prerequisite documentation</a></p>
                    <h2>13. Where can I receive further support?</h2>
                    <p>For further support with LME 2.0 users can explore the following options:
