                    <p><strong>Make sure to use <code class="inline">-i</code> to run a login shell with any commands that run as root,
                            so environment variables are set properly</strong> <a

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>The services take a while to start give it a few minutes before assuming things are
                            broken</strong></p>
                    <p>Confirm services are installed:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl list-unit-files lme\*</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>Debug if necessary. The first step is to check the status of individual services listed above:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-bash">#if something breaks, use these commands to debug:
SERVICE_NAME=lme-elasticsearch.service
sudo -i journalctl -xu $SERVICE_NAME</code></pre>

                    <p>If something is broken, try restarting the services and making sure failed services reset before starting:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-bash">#try resetting failed: 
sudo -i systemctl reset-failed lme*
sudo -i systemctl restart lme.service</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>Check that containers are running and healthy. This command will also print container names!</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo -i podman ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.Status}}"</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>Example output: </p>

                    <p>This also prints the names of the containers in the first column of text on the left. You&#39;ll
                        want the container names.</p>

                        won&#39;t show healthy and thats expected. Health checks for these services will be added in a
                        future version.</p>

                    <p>If you have alot of RAM (i.e., greater than 128GB) to work with and want your container to
                        consume that RAM (especially in the case of Elasticsearch running under the Java Virtual
                        Machine. Elasticsearch is written in Java). </p>
                    <p>So you&#39;ll want to edit the JVM options: <a

                    </p>
                    <p>By default Elastic only goes up to 31GB of memory usage if you don&#39;t set the appropriate
                        variable. If you have a server that has 128 GB and you want to use 64 (the recommendation is
                        half of your total memory) you need to set the ES_JAVA_OPTS variable. To do that you can edit
                        the .container and restart your lme.service like so:</p>
                    <pre><code>sudo nano /opt/lme/quadlet/lme-elasticsearch.container</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>add to the file something like this:</p>
                    <pre><code>Environment=ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms64g -Xmx64g</code></pre>

                    <h3>Elastic Specific Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <p>Elastic maintains a series of troubleshooting guides that we suggest you review as part of the
                        standard investigation process if the issue you are experiencing is within the Elastic stack
                        within LME.</p>
                    <p>These guides can be found <a
                            href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/troubleshooting.html">here</a>
                        and cover a number of common issues.</p>
                    <h3 id="kibana-discover-view-showing-wrong-index">Kibana Discover View Showing Wrong Index</h3>
                    <p>If the Discover section of Kibana persistently shows the wrong index by default, check that the
                        winlogbeat index pattern is still set as the default within Kibana. To do this, see the steps
                        below:</p>
                    <p>Select &quot;Stack Management&quot; from the left-hand menu:</p>
                    <p><img class="image" src="/docs/imgs/stack-management.png" alt="Check Default Index"></p>
                    <p>Select &quot;Index Patterns&quot; under Kibana Stack Management:</p>
                    <p><img class="image" src="/docs/imgs/index-patterns.png" alt="Check Default Index"></p>
                    <p>Verify that the &quot;Default&quot; label is set next to the <code>INDEX_NAME-*</code> Index
                        pattern:</p>
                    <p><img class="image" src="/docs/imgs/default-winlogbeat.png" alt="Check Default Index"></p>
                    <p>If this Index pattern is not selected as the default, this can be re-done by clicking on the
                        <code>INDEX_NAME-*</code> pattern and then selecting the following option in the subsequent
                        page:</p>
                    <p><img class="image" src="/docs/imgs/default-index-pattern.png" alt="Set Default Index"></p>
                    <h3>Unhealthy Cluster Status</h3>
                    <p>There are several reasons why the cluster&#39;s health may be yellow or red, but a common cause
                        is unassigned replica shards. As LME is a single-node instance by default this is means that
                        replicas will never be assigned. However, this issue is commonly caused by built-in indices
                        which do not have the <code>index.auto_expand_replicas</code> value correctly set. This will be
                        fixed in a future release of Elastic, but can be temporarily diagnosed and resolved as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>Check the cluster health by running the following request against Elasticsearch (an easy way to
                        do this is to navigate to <code>Dev Tools</code> in Kibana under <code>Management</code> on the
                        left-hand menu):</p>
                    <pre><code>GET _cluster/health?filter_path=status,*_shards</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>If it shows any unassigned shards, these can be enumerated with the following command:</p>
                    <pre><code>GET _cat/shards?v=true&h=index,shard,prirep,state,node,unassigned.reason&s=state</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>If the <code>UNASSIGNED</code> shard is shown as <code>r</code> rather than <code>p</code> this
                        means it&#39;s a replica. In this case tyou can fix the error in the single-node default
                        installation of LME by forcing all indices to have a replica count of 0 using the following
                        request:</p>
                    <pre><code>PUT _settings
{
  "index.number_of_replicas": 1
}</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>If the above solution was unable to resolve your issue, further information on this and general
                        advice on troubleshooting an unhealthy cluster status can be found <a

                        shows missing url for Fleet Server Host</h2>
                    <p>When trying to add Elastic Agent on host server, you may see <strong>Missing URL for Fleet Server
                            host</strong> as shown in screenshot below.</p>
                    <p><img class="image" src="/docs/imgs/fleetservermissingurl.png" alt="Check Default Index"></p>
                    <p>This can happen when LME post install steps were run before <em>lme-fleet-server</em> displayed
                        status of <strong>Up</strong> when you check podman status.
                        Do make sure your post installation verification steps are completed.
                        If post installation verification steps fail, then uninstall and re-install LME is recommended.
                        Otherwise a simple reboot of the host server or restart of lme-service should fix the problem.

                    <h3>Re-Indexing Errors</h3>
                    <p>For errors encountered when re-indexing existing data as part of an an LME version upgrade please
                        review the Elastic re-indexing documentation for help, available <a
                            href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html">here</a>.

                    <h3>Illegal Argument Exception While Re-Indexing
                    </h3>
                    <p>With the correct mapping in place it is not possible to store a string value in any of the fields
                        which represent IP addresses. For example <code>source.ip</code> or <code>destination.ip</code>.
                        If you see any of these values represented in your current data as strings, such as
                        <code>LOCAL</code> you cannot successfully re-index with the correct mapping. In this instance
                        the simplest fix is to modify your existing data to store the relevant fields as valid IP
                        representations using the update_by_query method, documented <a
                            href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update-by-query.html">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>An example of this is shown below, which may need to be modified for the particular field that is
                        causing problems:</p>
                    <pre><code>POST winlogbeat-11.06.2021/_update_by_query

    "lang": "painless"
  },
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "source.ip": "LOCAL"
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>Note that this will need to be run for each index that contains problematic data before
                        re-indexing can be completed.</p>
                    <h3>TLS Certificates Expired</h3>
                    <p>For security the self-signed certificates generated for use by LME at install time will only
                        remain valid for a period of two years, which will cause LME to stop functioning once these
                        certificates expire. In this case the certificates can be recreated by following the
